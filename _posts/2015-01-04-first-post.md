I found data from WWII on the types of models developed by each country. I created visualization for each area of combat. Infantry, vehicles, ships, and planes were all organized by the country they came from. This is not data on the amount of each model produced, but of how many types of models were researched and produced. Click the link below to go to my blog post for a breakdown of the data.
